Overview
========

Ewa (East-West Audio) is an application that manages the production of
spliced mp3 files.  It is meant to solve a common audio production
problem facing producers of audio for the web who would like to add
extra content such as credits and promotional or underwriting messages
to their mp3s and be able to update those messages periodically
without having to remaster all their mp3s from scratch.

Ewa makes a distinction between *content files* and *extra files*. The
content files contain the material of main interest; the extra files
are the promotional material.  Ewa assumes that one resultant mp3 is
normally an aggregation of exactly one content file with any number of
extra files. [#]_

In order to know what extra files to combine with a particular content
file, ewa consults a *rule*, which is a function that takes the name
of the requested file and returns an ordered list of files that should
be combined.  The rule ewa consults is usually a special kind of rule
called a *rule list* that contains a list of sub-rules; the first
sub-rule that matches, i.e., that returns a non-empty list, is the
return value of the parent rule.  Ewa provides a expressive
`mini-language`_ for specifying such rule lists; with it, rules can
apply only for filenames that match glob or regular expression
patterns, or that match date formats, or combinations of such criteria
with "and", "or", and "not" operators.  Also, rules can be made active
only for certain date ranges, so you can add configuration in January
that will only become effective in February.  If the rule system isn't
flexible enough and you have special needs, it is also feasible to
plug in your own, implemented in Python. 

Ewa also manages transcoding the extra audio to match the content
files with which it may be spliced. Master files for each piece of
extra audio are placed in a directory managed by ewa, and ewa
transcodes them as needed, leaving the transcoded files in another
managed directory for future runs. The masters may be in mp3, wav, or
aiff format.

.. _mini-language: ewaconf_

Modes of Operation
------------------

Ewa can operate either in batch mode, in which case it produces
combined files for the content files specified on the command line, or
in server mode.  

Batch Mode
~~~~~~~~~~

The batch mode, controlled by the script ewabatch_, is convenient if
you can't run your own persistent processes on the web server serving
your audio files; you can use it to produce static files on a
machine under your own control and rsync them up to the web server
however often you need.  Batch mode can operate either on individual
files or recursively on entire directories.


Server Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using ``ewabatch`` to generate all your files, there is no
need for any integration with the web server at all; you just need a
cron job to generate the files periodically and perhaps rsync them.
But if you have a large number of files, this can become unwieldy. Not
only must each new file must be processed before going live, but the
costs in time and bandwidth of changing intros for a large number of
mp3s and having to rsync them up to your webserver may be prohibitive
if undertaken frequently.  It is highly inefficient to have to move
thousands of files just because an intro has changed.  The ewa server
gets around this problem.

The server mode, controlled by the script ewa_, is a persistent daemon
running a simple WSGI_ application, normally connected to a web server
via FCGI_ or SCGI_, which generates the composite files on demand,
caching them on the filesystem and rebuilding them upon request with a
configurable frequency.  The path to the composite file is passed to
the webserver via the X-Sendfile_ technique (which originated with
lighttpd_ and is also supported by apache_ with the `mod_xsendfile`_
module; nginx_ also has a `similar feature`_).  The webserver is
responsible for returning the actual file over HTTP, and ewa
does not need to do IO; as a result, ewa processes each request
extremely quickly, and files are served at almost the same speed as
static files, with excellent scaleability.

Limitations
-----------

Ewa has a few limitations that the user should be aware of.

1. Mp3 is the only supported audio format.
2. Ewa only supports CBR (constant bit rate) encoding.  
3. Ewa's rule system only takes into account the name of the requested
   content file and the current time and date in determining the list
   of files to splice; in particular, it isn't currently suited to
   personalizing mp3 downloads.
4. Ewa currently does not support the dynamic writing of id3 tags; it
   takes whatever id3 tags are on the main content file and transfers
   them verbatim to the composite.
5. Ewa relies on the model of one content file + multiple extra files;
   scenarios with multiple content files aren't supported.

Some or all of these may be addressed in future revisions, depending
on community interest.

A Note on Mp3 Splicing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will occasionally read that mp3s cannot be reliably spliced, as
mp3 frames may store information used by later frames in the bit
reservoir.  This is not quite true; the reality is that mp3s cannot be
reliably *cut and spliced*.  In ewa, all the mp3s are spliced on
preexisting mp3 boundaries; they are not cut (except to drop a bad
frame at the end of a file).  Obviously, the last frame in an mp3 does
not store content in the bit reservoir for subsequent frames.
Therefore, the bit reservoir does not present a problem for ewa.

Ewa attempts to produce spliced files that are without bad frames; to
do so, it looks at the frames preceding frame boundaries and discard
broken ones.  However, ewa also attempts to splice very quickly, and
hence cannot scan entire mp3s to clean them; if the mp3s going into
ewa are broken, the ones coming out will be too.


Installation
============

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Ewa has been developed and tested on Linux, but should work fine on
any flavor of BSD, including Mac OS X, and commercial UNIX
implementations.  It hasn't been tested on Windows, but in future
might work there in whole or in part.  Please note that some parts of
this manual presuppose a UNIX platform.

Ewa is written in Python_, and requires Python 2.4 or later. In
addition, the following Python packages need to be installed:

* setuptools_ 
* simplejson_
* eyeD3_
* ply_ (>=2.2)
* flup_

To run tests you also need:

* nose_

Ewa also requires that lame_ be installed for transcoding.  To run the
ewa server, you need to run an http server that supports X-Sendfile_
or something equivalent: either lighttpd_, apache_ with
`mod_xsendfile`_, or possibly nginx_.

Getting Ewa
-----------

Ewa releases are available in binary and source form from
http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/ewa. 

If you want to follow the bleeding edge development version, you can
check out the latest source code from our subversion repository::

  svn co svn://svn.wnyc.org/public/ewa/trunk ewa


Software Installation
---------------------

To install, if you already have setuptools_ installed, you can simply
do::

  easy_install ewa

Or, if you have already installed the source tarball and have unpacked
it, cd into it and type::

  easy_install .

or equivalently::

  python setup.py install

The latter will install setuptools_ if you don't already have it.

The Managed Audio Directory
---------------------------

Ewa expects audio to be stored in a directory structure like:

 $basedir/main
	Your content mp3s go here; you manage this directory and can
	organize it however you like. Ewa needs read access to it.
 $basedir/extras/masters
	Your "extra" files -- intros, outros, ads, etc. -- go here;
	you manage this directory also.  Ewa needs read access to it
	also. 
 $basedir/extras/transcoded
	Ewa manages this directory and needs write access to it; it
	stores transcoded versions of the audio files extras/masters
	here. 
 $targetdir
	Ewa manages this directory and needs write access to it; this
	is where it stores the spliced files.

``basedir`` and ``targetdir`` are configuration-defined.  You must
specify ``basedir`` in ``ewa.conf``; ``targetdir`` will default to
``$basedir/combined`` if not otherwise specified.


Permissions Gotchas
-------------------

Some care is necessary to ensure that file permissions will be right
for your deployment, especially if you are running both the ewa server
and ewa batch processes, as a variety of users may then be creating
files in the managed directories.  

One approach is to create a user and group that the ewa server will
run as, give ownership of the managed directories to it, and make them
both group-writeable and the group permissions sticky.  On Linux, you
might do this::

  groupadd ewa
  useradd -g ewa -s /bin/false  -d $targetdir -c "ewa user" ewa
  chown -r ewa:ewa $targetdir $basedir/extras/transcoded
  chmod -r g+ws $targetdir $basedir/extras/transcoded

While you are at it, creating directories for ewa's pid file and log
file isn't a bad idea::

  mkdir -p /var/{run,log}/ewa && chown ewa /var/{run,log}/ewa

In ``ewa.conf`` you'll want to set the ``user`` and ``group``
variables to match the user and group you created.  If you do this,
``ewa`` and ``ewabatch`` will need to be run as root (in the case of
``ewabatch``, most conveniently through ``sudo``), but will drop
credentials to your user/group before it creates any files.


Configuration
=============

Ewa has two configuration files: ``ewa.conf``, for adminstrative
options, and a rule configuration file, which is used to determine
the playlists.

The ``ewa.conf`` File
---------------------

``ewa.conf`` is written in Python; keys defined there that don't start
with an underscore become attributes of the ``ewa.config.Config``
object.  The following are meaningful keys:

basedir
	The path to to the base audio directory.  Must be supplied, as
	there is no default.
rulefile
	The path to the file with ewa rules, either in Python, JSON or
	ewaconf.  If the file ends with ``.py``, it is assumed to be in
	Python; if with ``.json`` or ``.js``, in JSON; otherwise
	ewaconf.  This also must be supplied.
targetdir
	The path to the directory where ewa will place generated
	composite files.  If not supplied, basedir + ``/combined``
	will be used.
protocol
	what server protocol to use: one of ``'fcgi'``, ``'scgi'`` or
	``'http'``, defaulting to ``'fcgi'``.  ``'http'`` is for
	development only and should not be used otherwise.
interface
	an ip address like ``'127.0.0.1'``, which is the default.
port
	default: ``5000``.
unixsocket
	if you want to use a UNIX rather than a TCP/IP socket, put the
	path to the socket file here; e.g., ``'/var/run/ewa.socket'``.
umask
	if you are using a UNIX socket, this will determine its
	permissions; e.g., ``0600``.
logfile
	path to logfile.  By default there is no logfile and hence no
	logging. 
loglevel
	how much to log -- should be one of ``'debug'``, ``'info'``,
	``'warn'``,  or ``'critical'``, defaulting to ``'critical'``.  
logrotate
	if you want to rotate your logfiles, set this to one of the
	following: 

	* ``True``.  This will result in a logfile that rotates when
          the file reaches 10M in size; up to 10 backups will be kept.   
	* an integer meaning the maximum number of bytes that should
          be stored before rollover; up to 10 backups will be kept. 
	* a two-tuple of integers specifying the maximum number of
          bytes that should be stored before rollover and the number
          of backups to retain: e.g., ``(1e7, 5)``.
	* ``'daily'`` (rotates every day at midnight regardless of
          size) 
	* ``'weekly'`` (rotates on Monday at midnight)
	* a value accepted for the ``when`` constructor parameter of
	  ``logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler`` (see Python's 
          `logging documentation`_ for details): e.g., ``"D"``.
	* a ``when`` parameter, as above, followed by a colon and 
          a value accepted for ``TimedRotatingFileHandler``'s
          ``interval`` parameter (an integer); e.g, ``"D:3"``.

daemonize
	whether the server process should daemonize (default:
	``True``). 
use_xsendfile
	whether to send an X-Sendfile or equivalent header from the
	server process to the front-end web server (default:
	``True``). 
sendfile_header
	what flavor of X-Sendfile-ish header to send.
	``'X-Sendfile'`` is the default, but lighttpd in versions
	<=`.4.11 requires ``'X-LIGHTTPD-send-file'`` instead, and
	nginx uses ``'X-Accel-Redirect'`` (with slightly different
	semantics).  
stream
	whether to stream the concatenated file directly rather than
	saving to disk.  This is not a production-quality option;
	don't use it.
refresh_rate
	how often to refresh combined files, in seconds.  Default is
	``0`` (never refresh).
pidfile
	if daemonizing, where to put a pidfile (default: ``None``).
content_disposition
	if you want a ``Content-Disposition: attachment`` header, set
	this to ``'attachment'``.  Default is ``None``.
user
	If you run in either server or batch mode as root and want to
	drop credentials to another user/group, set this.
group
	Same as for user.
engine
	What splicing engine to use.  You don't want to change this or
	even know about it.
use_threads
	Whether to use a pool of threads rather than a pool of forked
	processes.  If the platform supports ``fork()``, this will
	default to ``False``; otherwise (that is, on Windows) to
	``True``. 
lame_path
	The path to the ``lame`` executable, for transcoding.  Default
	is ``/usr/bin/lame``.
min_spare
	For the `FCGI`_ and `SCGI`_ backends, the minimum number of
	spare threads or processes.  Defaults to 1. [#]_
max_spare
	For the `FCGI`_ and `SCGI`_ backends, the maximum number of
	spare threads or processes.  Defaults to 5.
max_threads
	For the `FCGI`_ and `SCGI`_ threaded backends, the maximum
	number of threads.  Default is unlimited.
max_children
	For the `FCGI`_ and `SCGI`_ preforked backends, the maximum
	number of child processes.  Default is 50.
max_requests
	For the `FCGI`_ and `SCGI`_ preforked backends, the maximum
	number of requests a child process handles before it is
	killed.  Default is 0 (unlimited).

The EWA Rule Configuration File
-------------------------------

The rule file can be written either in Python or in a special
configuration mini-language, ewaconf_. [#]_

.. _ewaconf: `The Ewaconf Configuration Language`_ 

A rule file in Python format gives you maximum flexibility, at the
cost of requiring you to know Python and understand the ewa API.  The
Python file can contain anything as long as it defines a global with
the name ``rules``, which should be a Python callable that, when
called, returns an iterator that yields symbolic names for the files
that should be combined.  (These names will be interpreted as file
paths relative to the ``extras/masters`` managed directory, unless
they have the Python attribute ``is_original`` set to a true value, in
which case, they will interpreted as file paths relative to the
``main`` managed directory.)  With this hook you can load into ewa
just about any sort of rule system that you might like to devise.


The Ewaconf Configuration Language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ewa's default rule configuration format is designed to make it easy to
define a list of rules that say, for a given mp3 file, what files ewa
should combine to make an aggregate file, and in what order.  The
rules are consulted in order, and checked to see if they match the
input mp3 file; the first one that matches returns a list of files to
combine, and those are then combined.  ``ewaconf`` only supports a
limited number of rule types, but nonetheless the system is quite
powerful. 

A rule is normally written in the form::

  condition [options]: 
     pre:  [file1,file2...] 
     post: [file1,file2...]

where a condition is a glob pattern, a regex pattern, or a date
specification, or combinations of the above with with the logical
operators ``and``, ``or``, and ``not``.  The ``pre`` and ``post``
lists indicate what files should go before or after the main content
file in the aggregate file ewa produces.  Condition options are put in
brackets after the condition and separated by commas; they can either
be a single symbol, such as ``F`` or ``I``, or a name-value pair,
separated by ``=``.  For example::

  bigband*.mp3 [I]: 
    pre: [bigbandintro.wav]
    post: [bigbandoutro.wav]
  regex:schwartz.*:
    pre: []
    post: []
  and(09/01/2006 - 11/01/2006 [F,fmt=YYYYMMDD], 
      or(lopate/*, bl/*):
    pre: []
    post: [specialoutro.mp3]

The regular expression follows Python regular expression rules.   If you want a
regex to ignore case, you can pass the ``I`` option.  Two other regex
options are supported: ``U`` (unicode) and ``L`` (locale).  These
correspond to the same options in the Python ``re`` module.  For more
information, see the `official Python documentation 
<http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-re.html>`_.

Globs support only one option: ``I``.  By default, globs are
case-sensitive, but if this option is passed they will ignore case.
(Globs are implemented with Python's fnmatch_ module.)

.. _fnmatch: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/module-fnmatch.html

Both globs and regexes can contain arbitary characters if they are
delimited with either single or double quotation marks.  They can also
be written without quotation marks, with some restrictions.  Spaces
are not permitted for either; for regexes, colons and commas must be
escaped with a preceding backslash. Unquoted globs are furthermore
restricted to alphanumeric characters, forward slashes, asterisks,
question marks, underscores, and periods.  When in doubt, quote.

.. hint :: Both globs and regexes need to match the *entire path* to
   requested file, relative to the main content file directory
   (``$basedir/main``); and furthermore globs and regexes have
   different matching behavior, in that a regex will match as long it
   matches against the beginning of the target string, but a glob
   needs to match all the way to the end.  So if someone requests
   ``http://bozoland.org/dingdong/frogling.mp3``, the path against which
   your pattern will be matched will be ``dingdong/frogling.mp3``,
   *without* a leading forward slash.  ``*frogling*`` would match it,
   as would ``regex:.*frogling``; ``frogling.mp3`` wouldn't, and
   neither would ``dingdong``, but ``regex:dingdong`` would.

The date options are ``F``, ``T``, and the name-value option ``fmt``.
``F`` and ``T`` are incompatible.  ``T`` is the default (so its use is
actually not necessary except perhaps for readability); it means that
the condition will return true only if the current time matches
against the date range specified.

``F`` means that the date is matched against the filename using a
regular expression derived from a format (the ``fmt`` option); the
default format is ``MMDDYYYY``.  Formats may be specified with the
following symbols:

* MM (months)
* DD (days)
* YY (2-digit year)
* YYYY (4-digit year)
* HH (hours, 24 hour clock)
* mm (minutes)
* PM (AM or PM)
* hh (hours, 12 hour clock)

Any additional characters in the format become a literal part of the
regular expression.  The ``fmt`` option has no meaning and may not be
used when matching against the current time.

If the pre and post lists are both empty, the special form ``default``
may be used.   Also, if a rule applies unconditionally, the condition
may be omitted.  Therefore, the following four forms are equivalent::

   *: pre: [], post: []
   *: default
   pre: [], post: []
   default

For regex rules, it is possible for the filenames in the pre and post
lists to back-reference named groups in the matching regex.  Named or
numbered group references can be used, with either a shell-like
interpolation style::

   regex:^/shows/(?P<showname>[^/]+)/.*\.mp3: 
      pre:  ["intro/$showname.mp3", "ad/${showname}.mp3"]
      post: ["notices/$1.mp3", "outro/${1}.mp3"]

or the style used by backreferences in Python `regular expression
expansions`_::

   regex:^/shows/(?P<showname>[^/]+)/.*\.mp3: 
      pre:  ["intro/\\g<showname>.mp3"]
      post: ["outro/\\1.mp3"]

Note that these forms need to be quoted.

.. warning:: Back-references can be used with compound conditions only
   if they refer to the last matching element in the compound
   condition -- and if the last element is itself compound, the last
   matching element of it, etc.  For instance, the first of the next
   two rules will work, and the second will not::

     # if this matches, the match result of the regex will be 
     # returned, and the back-reference will work
     and(>01-01-2001, (and(*nougat*, regex:"(foo|bar)"))):
         pre: ["$1.mp3"]
         post: []
     
     # if this matches, the match result of the date match 
     # will be returned, and back-references don't work
     # with those, so the literal string '$1.mp3' will be
     # used instead -- probably not what you want
     and((and(*nougat*, regex:"(foo|bar)"), >01-01-2001)):
         pre: ["$1.mp3"]
         post: []

   With ``and``, the last matching element will always the very last
   element.   With ``or``, however, that is not the case -- as soon as
   one of an ``or`` compound condition's sub-matchers matches, that
   match is returned and subsequent sub-matchers are ignored. 


.. _`regular expression expansions`: http://www.python.org/doc/current/lib/match-objects.html

It is convenient under some circumstances to nest lists of rules, with
a conditional qualifier shared by all of them.  To do this, enclose
the nested list of rules in matching brackets::

   regex:shows/(?P<showname>[^/]+)/.*: [
       <=09-01-2005 [F]: default
       09-02-2005 - 10-14-2006 [F]: 
          pre: ["intro/$showname.mp3"]
          post: []
       >10-15-2006 [F]: 
          pre: [current.mp3]
          post: [current.mp3]
       ]

For a complete reference, see the `grammar specification`_ below.

.. _`grammar specification`: `Appendix I. ewaconf Formal Grammar Specification`_

Checking the Syntax of the Configuration Files
----------------------------------------------

The ewabatch_ script, when run with the ``-t`` option, will perform
a syntax check on both ``ewa.conf`` and the rulefile, and either exit
with a ``Syntax OK`` message or blow up with a possibly helpful
traceback.


Configuring the Web Server
--------------------------


Two recommended options for integrating ewa with a web server are
discussed below. [#]_

Lighttpd
~~~~~~~~

First of all, enable ``fastcgi`` in ``ewa.conf``.  If you are using
lighttpd_ in version 1.4.11 or lower, set ``sendfile_header`` to
``'X-LIGHTTPD-send-file'``.

Then use something like the following lighttpd configuration:

.. include :: ../conf/lighttpd.conf.sample
  :literal:


Apache with mod_xsendfile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TBD. This should be a fairly straightforward combination of `mod_scgi`_ and
`mod_xsendfile`_. 

.. _`mod_scgi`: SCGI_


Using The CLI Programs
======================

Below are summaries of the commandline options of ``ewa`` and
``ewabatch``, and also for a third less important program,
``ewasplice``, which provides lower-level access to ewa's splicing
facilities.

``ewabatch``
------------

usage: ``ewabatch`` [options] [files]

Produces a combined MP3 file according to the specified rules.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIGFILE, --config=CONFIGFILE
                        path to ewa config file
  -r, --recursive       recurse through directories
  --rulefile=RULEFILE   specify a rulefile
  -d, --debug           print debugging information
  -n, --dry-run         don't do anything, just print what would be done
  -e ENGINE, --engine=ENGINE
                        which splicing engine to use (default ewa splicer,
                        mp3cat, or sox)
  -a, --absolute        interpret file paths relative to the filesystem rather
                        than the basedir (default: no)
  -t, --configtest      just test the config file for syntax errors

.. hint:: With both ``ewabatch`` and ``ewa``, if you don't specify a config
   file, ewa will look for it in ``~/.ewa/ewa.conf`` and
   ``/etc/ewa.conf``.


``ewa``
-------

usage: ``ewa`` [options]

Starts ewa's WSGI application that produces combined MP3 files
according to the specified rules.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIGFILE, --config=CONFIGFILE
                        path to ewa config file
  -D, --nodaemonize     don't daemonize, regardless of config settings



``ewasplice``
-------------

usage: ``ewasplice`` [options] files

This utility splices MP3 files together using the ewa splicer, but
doesn't use the managed directories or perform automatic
transcoding. You have to specify a file as  "tagfile" so it knows
where to get id3 tags.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUT, --output=OUT  output file (default: stdout)
  -t TAGFILE, --tagfile=TAGFILE
                        tag file
  -d, --debug           print debugging information
  -s, --sanitycheck     sanity check the input mp3 files
  -e ENGINE, --engine=ENGINE
                        which splicing engine to use (default ewa splicer,
                        mp3cat, or sox)


Appendix I. ``ewaconf`` Formal Grammar Specification
====================================================


Normative EBNF
--------------

The below is an EBNF grammar for the rule configuration format::

 grammar 	:= cond_rule [','? cond_rule]*
 rulelist 	:= '[' cond_rule [','? cond_rule]* ']'
 cond_rule 	:= [cond ':']? rule
 rule 		:= simplerule | rulelist
 simplerule 	:= prelist ','? postlist | postlist ','? prelist | 'default'
 prelist	:= 'pre' ':' speclist 
 postlist	:= 'post' ':' speclist
 speclist	:= '[' [specifier [',' specifier]*]? ']'
 specifier	:= string
 string         := BAREWORD | QWORD
 cond		:= cond_expr | simple_cond 
 cond_expr	:= cond_op '(' cond [',' cond]+ ')'
 cond_expr	:= NOT '(' cond ')'
 cond_op	:= 'and' | 'or'
 simple_cond	:= regex | glob | datespec
 regex		:= BAREREGEX condopts? | QREGEX condopts?
 glob		:= string condopts?
 datespec       := daterange condopts?
 daterange	:= [date '-' date] | [ datecompare date ] | date
 datecompare	:= '<' | '<=' | '>' | '>=' | '='
 date           := DATE | DATETIME
 condopts       := '[' condopt [',' condopt]* ']'
 condopt        := BAREWORD | BAREWORD '=' BAREWORD
  

Lexical Details
---------------


Significant Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tokens that the lexer must produce will be:

 BAREWORD
     an unquoted string with alphanumeric characters, asterisks,
     backslashes, question marks, underscores, or periods.
 QWORD
     a string delimited by single or double quotation marks.  Internal
     quotation marks of the same type used as the delimiter must be
     escaped.
 BAREREGEX
     a string that matches a regex; should start with ``regex:``,
     followed by an unquoted string with the same restrictions as
     BAREWORD above.
 QREGEX
     like a BAREREGEX, but the regex, after the ``regex:`` prefix, 
     is delimited by single or double quotation marks, and escaping
     (except of quotation marks) is not necessary.
 DATE
     MM-DD-YYYY format.  The separator can also be a slash (/) or a
     period (.), but the same separator must be used in both
     positions. 
 DATETIME
     MM-DD-YYYY HHMM format.  The separator can also be a slash or
     period, as with DATE, and the space before the hour can be either
     a space or the previously used separator.
 DEFAULT
    'default'
 PRE
    'pre'
 POST
    'post'
 AND
    'and'
 OR
    'or'
 OP
    '<', '<=', '>', '>=', '='
 DASH
    '-'
 COMMA
    ','
 COLON
    ':'
 LBRACK
    '['
 RBRACK
    ']'
 LPAREN
    '('
 RPAREN
    ')'

Ignored Tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any text on a line after a pound sign (#) is a comment and is ignored.
Whitespace, including line returns, is ignored between tokens.
Indentation may be freely used to clarify patterns.

Complete Example
----------------

.. include :: ../conf/rules.conf.sample
  :literal:



.. [#] There are use cases in which you might want more than one
    content file -- one for each segment of a radio program, for
    instance -- but this usage is not currently supported. 

.. [#] The stated default value of this config variable, and of the
   several following which refer to the configuration of the FCGI_ and
   SCGI_ daemons,  are actually enforced by flup_; the value help in
   ``Config``  object for all of them is actually ``None``.

.. [#] Actually, there is a third format -- a special dialect of JSON_
    -- but it isn't very useful and may be dropped in a future
    release. 

.. _JSON: http://www.json.org/

.. [#] Other options are possible.  In addition to nginx, mentioned
   elsewhere, it would be possible run ewa's WSGI application in
   another WSGI container or even a CGI.  With Apache's
   ``mod_rewrite`` it is possible to detect whether a static file is
   available and serve it directly if so, and only call a splicing
   backend if not, which, if X-Sendfile were not available, could
   accomplish much the same thing with an external redirect.
