# Why do I want this? #

Let's say you are or work for an organization (like a public radio station) that produces hundreds of hours of programming a month which you make available on mp3, and would like to pre- and postpend promotional clips: ads, credits, informational messages. These clips may quickly cease to be relevant, and you may even charge for their inclusion and want to be able to remove them at a set time and replace them with something else; but you don't want to remaster thousands of files to do it. That's the problem ewa solves.

# What does East-West Audio mean? #

East-West Audio was originally conceived as a collaborative project by public radio stations on opposite coasts of the United States: WNYC New York Public Radio and KCRW in Santa Monica, California.

# Does ewa support any formats besides MP3? #

Not at the moment.

# Does ewa run on Windows? #

Probably not out of the box. It was developed and tested on Linux. However, if you need to run in on Windows for some peculiar reason and are adventurous, give it a shot and submit the inevitable patches.

# Why was this released with version "0.62"? #

Because the composer Erik Satie gave his first published composition, a little piano piece called "Valse-Ballet", the opus number "62".
